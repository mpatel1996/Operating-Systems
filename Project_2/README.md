# OS Project 2
-------------------------------------------------
# Project_2 Folder Contains:
- Algorithm Folder
- Reference String
- Example of outputs for all three Algorithms for each frame Sizes
- Averages for all 3 outputs and their frame sizes

# Algorithm Folder contains:
- Driver.java
- fifo.java
- lru.java
- optimal.java


# IMPORTANT
If you would like to see output of frame for each strings, 
Comment out the Sys.out.print from each algorithm files. 

Otherwise, an example of the output is thrown into an output file
named, <NameOfAlgo>_<pageFrameSize>_Output.txt
